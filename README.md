<h1>Water Level Indicator Cologne</h1>
A program that measures and graphs the water level of the Rhine

<h2>Overview</h2>

Welcome to my project developed for the <a href="https://digitalheritagelab.com">Digital Heritage Lab</a>. In this project, we are using the data provided to us by Cologne Open Data to develop an API using Python-Flask and measure the water levels in Cologne to assess the danger level. In this way, we can have information about whether the water level is dangerous or not and make the work of people working in this field easier. The starting point of the project was the disruption of an archaeological excavation due to the lack of knowledge of the water level. In this way, we produce a solution to a real world problem.

<h2>Project Objective</h2>

Our main goal is to create a program that measures and reports the water levels in the city of Cologne and warns of danger. Our main goal is to make the program and api more usable with graphics and 3D visualizations.

<h2>Done</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Data will be withdrawn from <a href="https://www.stadt-koeln.de/interne-dienste/hochwasser/pegel_ws.php">API.</a></li>
  <li>The data will be displayed live on an html page with JS converted into a graphic and displayed live.</li>
  <li>An image showing the water level will be added and it will peak at 1.2 above</li>
</ul>
